# Documentation for Notebook Entry Search Project
Notebook Entry Search Service is used to search frequency of word and similar words against given words

## Reference Documentation

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Approach
- Created one microservice notebookentry-search-service
- Since we are keeping the data in memory, both the APIs should be up for proper function
- Full API documentation for tick-consumer-service is available on http://localhost:8080/api-docs.html
- Embedded H2 database has been used to store notebooks and its entries
- schema.sql and data.sql are loaded while application intialization and dummy notebooks with notebook entries are created

## Assumptions
- Notebooks and notebook entries already exist in the system
- Levenshtein Distance is case-senstive. For eg. Word and WORD are not similar words

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. 
One way is to execute the `main` method 

execute the `main` method of `com.labforward.notebook.NotebookEntrySearchServiceApp` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)
like so:

```
